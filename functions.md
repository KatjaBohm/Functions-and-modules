# Functions

## What is a function?

Function is a block of organized, reusable code that makes the code 
effective, clearer and easier to handle. You can think functions as little self-contained programs that can perform a specific task 
which you can use repeatedly in your code. One of the basic principles in programming is "not to repeat yourself", i.e. you shouldn't have
duplicate lines of code in your script. Function is a way to avoid that. During the course we have actually already used some functions such as
`print()` command which is a built-in function in Python.
  
**TODO**

- Explain different parts of function
- Create a simple function
- Create a py-file with functions
- import those functions from the file and use them from another file.
