# Functions and libraries
Lesson 4: Using Spyder, functions and libraries

During the fourth week we will learn how to create and use functions that are one of the most useful concepts in programming. We will also introduce you
to the concept of library (often referred as module in Python) which you can think of being sort of a tool-box for specific purpose. Each library contains
specific functionalities (i.e. functions) that you can use for different tasks. Thus functions and libraries are closely related concepts.
